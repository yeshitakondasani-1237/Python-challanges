Challenge-1:
The task is to take user details such as Full Name, Email ID, Mobile Number, and Age as input and validate them based on given constraints.
Since there are multiple conditions to verify, we need to use basic if-else statements along with a few inbuilt functions like len(), count(), and isdigit(). Even though the problem has many constraints, it can be solved logically by breaking it into smaller validation steps. This challenge helps us understand how complex validation rules can be implemented using simple programming concepts. 
Challenge-2:
By applying small concepts like length checking, character comparison, and counting characters, we successfully validated Student ID, Email ID, Password, and Reference Code. This shows that even with simple tools and fundamental logic, we can develop a smart and reliable registration system. The challenge helped us strengthen our understanding of core programming concepts and improved our problem-solving skills.
Challenge-3:
We must store marks in a list, loop through them, and classify each mark into categories like Excellent, Good, or Fail based on given ranges. While processing, the program should also count total valid students and total failed students. At the end, a summary must be displayed. Additionally, we must include one personalized logic rule that changes the program’s output based on our own detail (like name length or register number).
Challenge-4:
The program takes a mixed list of inputs containing numbers and strings from the user.It processes each element using a loop and separates numbers and strings into two different lists.Empty strings are ignored, and the total count of numbers and strings is calculated.Finally, a personalization rule (like section logic) is applied to change the output.
Challenge-5:
This program takes multiple weight values from the user and categorizes them into different load groups based on predefined ranges.It also identifies invalid (negative) weights separately.Then, it calculates a Personal Load Index (PLI) using the length of the user’s full name modulo 3.Based on the PLI value, certain categories of weights are removed or marked invalid.Finally, it displays the updated categories along with total valid and affected weights.
Challenge-6:
This problem asks us to analyze a playlist of song durations (in seconds).We must check if the playlist is too short, too long, repetitive, balanced, irregular, or invalid.Based on conditions, the program should print the category and recommendation.
